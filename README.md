Python practices

1. Practice on class in Python programming:
	-> From class to objects
	-> Class enables to generate a new instance of a type.
	-> Class is defined as template that brings data and function together.
	-> Each instance consist of method that help to change its state and property for better presservation.
	-> eg. a Dog class
2. Class
	-> We can think of a class as a template, the template that has its
	   shape (attribute) which will make a product (object) that takes
	   a specific shape . e.g making a heart cake we have a heart shaped
	   container (attribute) that makes a cake (object)

	   A real example:-

	   class Car:	--> template

	   color
	   name
	   mode		--> 3 attributes

	   from class Car
	   Car.name = BMW
	   Car.color = Blue
	   Car.model = 2023	--> object

	   Creating and using the class

-> Classes may be used to model practically anything.
-> Take an example of a Dog and create a class of Dog to represent dogs in general.
	- A dog has a name, age. Also they sit and roll over.
	- Due to fact that they have two characteristics (name and age)
	  and two actions (sit and roll over). They will be included in class
	- The class will instruct Python on how to create a dog themed object.
	   after creating the class we use it to create various instances to
	   represent a particular dog.
	- So, each instance created from a Dog class will store name and age
	  and give each dog ability to sit() and roll_over()
